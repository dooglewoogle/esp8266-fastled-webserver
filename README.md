Sunrise pattern. This slowly fades on blue/white from the middle out, then orange. Once max width has been reached, stops and stays. 

Presunrise pattern. Reset the sunrise, also turn on one led at the start of the strip, mainly to let me know that I don't have to try to go back to sleep if I wake up early and it's still dark. 


Power button. Button that toggles the power setting. Makes it much more useful as a lamp.
